Unfortunately, there isn’t a direct equivalent to these SwiftUI extensions in C#. The concept of a View and the ability to extend it with additional functionality like this is specific to SwiftUI. In C#, user interface elements are typically represented as classes (like Button or TextBox in WPF), and you can’t add methods to an existing class like you can with Swift’s extensions. However, you can create helper methods or extension methods that take an instance of a UI element as a parameter and perform similar transformations. The exact implementation would depend on the specific UI framework you’re using in C#. For example, in WPF you might create a static UIElementExtensions class with extension methods for the UIElement class (which is a base class for most UI elements in WPF). But the functionality would not be as seamless or as flexible as with SwiftUI’s view extensions. If you provide more details about your C# project and what you’re trying to achieve, I might be able to give more specific advice or code examples.
