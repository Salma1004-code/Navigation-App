The Swift code you provided is an extension to the AVAudio3DPoint class. It adds a new initializer that takes a bearing (in degrees) and a distance, and converts them into a 3D point in a virtual space. The bearing is converted to radians and adjusted for the difference between the real world’s coordinate system and the virtual world’s coordinate system.


The Swift code you provided is an extension to the AVAudioPlayer class. It adds several methods to initialize an audio player from a file located in different places: the shared folder, the asset catalog, or the main bundle. The file type hint is used to specify the type of the audio file. If the file cannot be found, it throws an AudioPlayerError.fileNotFound error.


The Swift code you provided is extending several enumerations (AVAudioSession.RouteChangeReason, AVAudioSession.InterruptionType, AVAudioSession.SilenceSecondaryAudioHintType, AVAudioSession.ErrorCode) from the AVAudioSession class with a description property. This property provides a string representation for each enumeration case.
