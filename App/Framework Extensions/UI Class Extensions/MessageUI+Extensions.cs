In C#, there isn’t a direct equivalent to these extensions because the MessageUI framework is specific to iOS. However, if you’re using a framework like Xamarin.Forms to create a cross-platform app, you could potentially achieve a similar effect by customizing the navigation bar in your platform-specific code. The exact implementation would depend on the specific UI framework you’re using in C#. If you provide more details about your C# project and what you’re trying to achieve, I might be able to give more specific advice or code examples.
