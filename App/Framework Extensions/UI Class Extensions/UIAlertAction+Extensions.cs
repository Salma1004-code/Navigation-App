Unfortunately, there isn’t a direct equivalent to this extension in C#. The UIAlertAction class and the concept of opening URLs from an app are specific to iOS. In a C# desktop application, you might use the System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(url) method to open a URL in the default browser, but this wouldn’t be wrapped in an action like in the iOS code. If you’re developing a C# application for a different platform or using a different framework, the exact method for opening a URL might be different. If you provide more details about your C# project and what you’re trying to achieve, I might be able to give more specific advice or code examples.
