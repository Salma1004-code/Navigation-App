The Swift code you’ve provided is extending the AVSpeechSynthesisVoice class with two additional methods: hasEnhancedVersion() and hasEnhancedVersionDownloaded(). These methods are used to check if an enhanced version of a voice is available and if it’s already downloaded, respectively.

In C#, you can achieve similar functionality by extending the equivalent class (if it exists) with extension methods. However, please note that the AVSpeechSynthesisVoice class and its methods are specific to Apple’s AVFoundation framework and may not have direct equivalents in .NET or other C# libraries. You might need to find or create similar classes in C# to fully replicate the functionality.
