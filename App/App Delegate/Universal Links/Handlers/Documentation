RecreationalActivityLinkHandler class: This class handles universal links related to recreational activities.
Parameters struct: This struct is used to hold the parameters extracted from the universal link.
HandleUniversalLink: This method handles the universal link by parsing query items, checking if the activity is already downloaded, and either transitioning to show the activity or initiating the download process.

This Swift code defines a class named ShareMarkerLinkHandler, which handles universal links related to shared markers. 
Explanation:
HandleUniversalLink: This method handles the universal link by parsing query items, creating MarkerParameters from them, and then handling those parameters.
Handle: This method fetches the underlying entity associated with the marker location and imports the marker.
ImportMarker: This method notifies that the marker import was successful by posting a notification with information about the imported marker.
DidFailToImportMarker: This method notifies that the marker import failed by posting a notification.
Please ensure to adapt the MarkerParameters, POI, NotificationCenter, and GDLogUniversalLinkError classes/methods to your C# codebase as per your application's design and requirements.


This Swift code defines a protocol named UniversalLinkHandler, which declares a method handleUniversalLink that should be implemented by types conforming to this protocol.
Explanation:
public interface UniversalLinkHandler: This declares an interface named UniversalLinkHandler.
void HandleUniversalLink(List<UriQueryItem> queryItems, UniversalLinkVersion version): This method declaration specifies a method that should handle universal links. It takes a list of UriQueryItem as query parameters and a UniversalLinkVersion.
This C# code defines an interface that fulfills the same purpose as the Swift protocol UniversalLinkHandler.
