This Swift code defines a struct called UniversalLinkComponents, which represents components of a universal link used in an iOS application.In the conversion to C#, the Uri class is used to handle URLs, and HttpUtility class is used for URL decoding and encoding. Additionally, the UniversalLinkPathComponents and UriQueryItem classes are introduced to represent the path components and query items respectively.



This Swift code defines an enum called UniversalLinkPath, which represents different paths that can be used in a universal link URL.
Explanation:
public enum UniversalLinkPath: This declares an enumeration named UniversalLinkPath.
Experience, ShareMarker: These are enum members representing different paths in the universal link URL.
public static class UniversalLinkPathExtensions: This is a static class used to define extension methods for the UniversalLinkPath enum.
ToRawValue extension method: This method converts enum values to their corresponding raw string values. It is used to mimic the behavior of Swift's rawValue property.



This Swift code defines a struct named UniversalLinkPathComponents, which represents the components of a universal link path, including the path itself and its version.
Explanation:
UniversalLinkPathComponents class: This class holds the components of a universal link path.
Path and Version properties: These properties hold the parsed path and version components respectively.
VersionedPath property: This property generates the complete versioned path by combining the version and path components.
Constructor UniversalLinkPathComponents(string path): This constructor parses a given path string into its components, including the path and version.
Constructor UniversalLinkPathComponents(UniversalLinkPath path): This constructor constructs UniversalLinkPathComponents with a given path and determines the current version for that path.


This Swift code defines an enum named UniversalLinkVersion, representing different versions that can be used in a universal link URL.
Explanation:
enum UniversalLinkVersion: This declares an enumeration named UniversalLinkVersion.
v1, v2, v3: These are enum members representing different versions in the universal link URL.
CurrentVersionForPath method: This static method determines the current version based on the given UniversalLinkPath. Depending on the path, it returns a specific version.
DefaultVersion property: This static property represents the default version (v1).
