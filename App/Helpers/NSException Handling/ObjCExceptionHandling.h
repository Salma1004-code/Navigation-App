Unfortunately, there isn’t a direct equivalent to this in C# because C# uses a different error handling model based on try/catch blocks and exception objects. However, you could potentially create a similar method in C# that takes an Action delegate (similar to the tryBlock in the Objective-C method) and a out Exception parameter (similar to the error parameter), executes the Action in a try/catch block, and assigns any caught exception to the out Exception parameter. But please note that this is not a common pattern in C# and is generally not recommended because it goes against the language’s idiomatic error handling practices. In C#, it’s usually better to use try/catch blocks directly where you need to handle exceptions.
