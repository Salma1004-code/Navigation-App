The provided Swift code defines a generic BoundedStack struct. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

bound: This is the maximum number of elements that the stack can hold.
elements: This is an array that holds the elements of the stack.
init(bound: UInt): This is the initializer for the stack. It sets the bound and ensures it’s greater than zero.
push(_ value: T): This method adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack exceeds its bound, it removes the bottom element.
push(contentsOf array: [T]): This method adds multiple elements to the stack. If the stack exceeds its bound, it removes the bottom elements.
pop() -> T?: This method removes and returns the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns nil.
remove(where predicate: (T) -> Bool) -> [T]: This method removes all elements that satisfy the given predicate and returns them.
clear(): This method removes all elements from the stack.
peek() -> T?: This method returns the top element of the stack without removing it. If the stack is empty, it returns nil.
isEmpty: Bool: This computed property checks if the stack is empty.
count: Int: This computed property returns the number of elements in the stack.



The provided Swift code defines a CircularQuantity struct that represents a quantity in a circular space (like an angle). It provides properties and methods to work with this quantity in both degrees and radians. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

valueInDegrees and valueInRadians: These are the values of the circular quantity in degrees and radians, respectively.
init(valueInDegrees: Double) and init(valueInRadians: Double): These are initializers that create a CircularQuantity from a value in degrees or radians, respectively.
normalized() -> CircularQuantity: This method returns a new CircularQuantity where the degree value is normalized to the range [0, 360).
The Comparable extension allows CircularQuantity instances to be compared and operated on using standard operators (==, >, <, +, -, and unary -).
The CustomStringConvertible extension provides a description property that returns the degree value as a string.


The provided Swift code defines a generic doubly linked list with LinkedListNode and LinkedList classes. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

LinkedListNode<T>: This class represents a node in the linked list. It has a value of generic type T, and optional next and previous pointers to other nodes.
LinkedList<T>: This class represents the linked list itself. It maintains a count of nodes, and pointers to the first and last nodes in the list.
append(_ value: T): This method adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
node(at: Int) -> LinkedListNode<T>?: This method returns the node at the given index, or nil if the index is out of bounds.
clear(): This method removes all nodes from the list.
remove(_ node: LinkedListNode<T>) -> T: This method removes the given node from the list and returns its value.


The provided Swift code defines a minimal implementation of a Promise. A Promise is a programming construct that can be used to represent a value which may not be available yet. It’s commonly used in asynchronous programming.

Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

State<T>: This is an enumeration that represents the state of the Promise. It can either be pending (the value is not yet available) or resolved (the value is available).
state: This property holds the current state of the Promise.
Resolver: This is a type alias for a closure that takes a value and returns void. It’s used to resolve the Promise with a value.
queue: This is a DispatchQueue used to synchronize access to the callbacks array.
callbacks: This is an array of Resolver closures that will be called when the Promise is resolved.
init(executor: (_ resolve: @escaping Resolver) -> Void): This is the initializer for the Promise. It takes an executor closure that takes a Resolver closure as its argument. The executor is responsible for resolving the Promise.
then(onResolved: @escaping Resolver): This method is used to add a callback to be called when the Promise is resolved.
resolve(_ value: Value): This method is used to resolve the Promise with a value. It updates the state of the Promise to resolved and triggers the callbacks.
updateState(to newState: State<Value>): This method is used to update the state of the Promise. It checks if the current state is pending before updating it.
triggerCallbacksIfResolved(): This method is used to trigger the callbacks if the Promise is resolved. It checks if the state is resolved and if so, it calls all the callbacks with the resolved value and then removes all the callbacks.



The provided Swift code defines a generic Queue struct that uses a LinkedList for storage. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

list: This is a linked list that holds the elements of the queue.
queue: This is a DispatchQueue used to synchronize access to the list.
count: This computed property returns the number of elements in the queue.
isEmpty: This computed property checks if the queue is empty.
init(): This is the initializer for the queue. It initializes the list.
enqueue(_ value: T): This method adds an element to the end of the queue.
dequeue() -> T?: This method removes and returns the first element of the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns nil.
clear(): This method removes all elements from the queue.
peek() -> T?: This method returns the first element of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns nil.



The provided Swift code defines a ThreadSafeValue class that wraps a value in a thread-safe manner using a concurrent queue. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

_value: This is the value that is being made thread-safe.
queue: This is a DispatchQueue used to synchronize access to _value.
value: This computed property provides thread-safe read and write access to _value. Reads are done synchronously, while writes are done asynchronously with a barrier.
init(_ value: T? = nil, qos: DispatchQoS): This is the initializer for the class. It takes an optional initial value and a quality of service level for the queue.


The provided Swift code defines a Token class that tokenizes a string based on a given separator. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

separator: This is the character or string that separates the tokens.
tokens: This is a set of unique tokens extracted from the input string.
tokenizedString: This is a string representation of the tokens sorted and joined by the separator.
init(tokens: Set<String>, separatedBy separator: String): This is a private initializer that takes a set of tokens and a separator, and initializes the Token instance.
init(string: String, separatedBy separator: String): This is a convenience initializer that takes a string and a separator, tokenizes the string, and initializes the Token instance.
intersection(other: Token) -> Token: This method takes another Token instance, finds the intersection of their tokens, and returns a new Token instance with the intersecting tokens
