The provided Swift code defines a ExperimentConfiguration struct that conforms to the Codable protocol, which means it can be encoded to and decoded from a serialized format (like JSON). Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

uuid: This is a unique identifier for the experiment configuration.
experimentIDs: This is a list of unique identifiers for the experiments.
probability: This is a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents the probability that this list of experiments is enabled for any given user.
locales: This is a list of locales in which this configuration is available.



The provided Swift code defines a ExperimentDescription struct that conforms to the Codable protocol, which means it can be encoded to and decoded from a serialized format (like JSON). Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

uuid: This is a unique identifier for the experiment description.
name: This is the name of the experiment.


This Swift code defines a class ExperimentManager responsible for managing experiments. Here's the breakdown:

Enum KnownExperiment:

Enumerates known experiments.
Provides a computed property uuid to generate UUIDs for each experiment (though it's commented out with a placeholder).
Defines a static constant configurationVersion.
Protocol ExperimentManagerDelegate:

Defines a delegate protocol with a method onExperimentManagerReady() to notify when the experiment manager is ready.
Class ExperimentManager:

Manages experiments, including downloading, saving, and loading configurations.
Uses FileManager to handle file I/O operations.
Utilizes DispatchQueue for asynchronous operations.
Contains methods to initialize the manager, check if an experiment is enabled, and configure the state of an experiment.
Implements methods to load and save experiment configurations from/to disk



This Swift code defines a class ExperimentServiceModel responsible for interacting with experiment services. Here's the breakdown:

Enum ExperimentServiceError:

Enumerates errors that can occur while interacting with the experiment service.
Class ExperimentServiceModel:

Manages communication with the experiment service.
Provides methods to download experiment configurations and descriptions.
Uses URLSession for network requests.
Defines completion handlers to handle success or failure of network requests.


The provided Swift code defines a Flight struct that conforms to the Codable protocol, which means it can be encoded to and decoded from a serialized format (like JSON). Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

etag: This is the ETag for the control file downloaded from the experiment service that was parsed into this Flight object.
configurations: This is the set of experiment configurations for this flight.
configStates: This is a dictionary containing flags for each experiment configuration indicating whether that control is active or not.
experimentDescriptions: This is the set of experiment descriptions for each experiment.
init(etag: String, configurations: [ExperimentConfiguration], configStates: [UUID: Bool]): This is an initializer used when decoding a flight object from a json file saved to disk.
init(etag: String, configurations: [ExperimentConfiguration]): This is an initializer used when setting up a flight for the first time. This will randomly turn experiment configurations on or off according to the probability specified in the configuration objects.
isActive(_ experimentID: UUID, locale: Locale = LocalizationContext.currentAppLocale) -> Bool: This function checks if an experiment is active.
setIsActive(configId uuid: UUID, isActive: Bool): This function is used to configure the state of an experiment configuration
