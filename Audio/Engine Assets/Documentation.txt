This Swift code defines a set of enums conforming to the DynamicAudioEngineAsset protocol, representing different types of beacons and related audio assets. The beacons are categorized into original, exploratory, and distance-based types, each with specific audio assets and configurations.

Explanation of Swift Code:

    Original Beacons:
        Enums like ClassicBeacon, V2Beacon, etc., represent original beacons.
        Each case within these enums corresponds to a specific audio asset, and DynamicAudioEngineAsset protocol is used for common functionality.

    Exploratory Beacons:
        Enums like TactileBeacon, FlareBeacon, etc., represent exploratory beacons.
        Similar to original beacons, each case corresponds to a specific audio asset.

    Distance-Based Beacon (ProximityBeacon):
        Represents distance-based beacons with cases for "far" and "near."
        The selector property calculates the proximity based on the distance between the user and the beacon. It returns a tuple with the selected asset and intensity based on the distance.

    Helper Assets (BeaconAccents, PreviewWandAsset):
        Enums like BeaconAccents and PreviewWandAsset represent helper assets.
        These enums have specific audio assets without distance-based selection logic.
